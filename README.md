A repo that contains all the code and guides for doing basic spike sorting in a containerized webapp using docker. 

# How to run:

2. Pull this repo
3. Run the SPIKESORT shortcut (Only works for windows machines, but can be expanded for Unix systems iun the future)
4. A comand line terminal will run and ask for a prompt
```ENTER THE FULL PATH TO THE SPIKESORT INPUT DATA:```
Copy and paste the path into the terminal of the folder that contains the `data` folder where all the spikesort input data is located. 
e.g. `C:\Users\Padilla-Coreano\Desktop\GITHUB_REPOS\diff_fam_social_memory_ephys` is a correct example. `C:\Users\Padilla-Coreano\Desktop\GITHUB_REPOS\diff_fam_social_memory_ephys\data` is not.
5. Press `Enter` and let it run.
